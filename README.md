    ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Carl.
    <br>
    <br>Iâ€™m interested in using data to improve governance and public goods funding.
    <br>
    <br>I'm currently working on <a href="https://www.opensource.observer/">Open Source Observer</a> and building a <a href="https://kariba.network/">network of impact data scientists</a>.
    <br>
    <br>Before that, I worked at <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a> on <a href="https://hypercerts.org/">hypercerts</a>. I also cofounded <a href="https://enveritas.org">Enveritas</a>, the leading source of sustainability data for the coffee supply chain.
    <br>
    <br>You can check out my writing at <a href="https://cerv.one">cerv.one</a>. Or follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/carl_cervone">Twitter</a> (at least until we find a better way of coordinating).
